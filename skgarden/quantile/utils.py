def weighted_percentile(a, q, weights=None, sorter=None):
    """
    Returns the weighted percentile of a at q given weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a: array-like, shape=(n_samples,)
        samples at which the quantile.

    q: int
        quantile.

    weights: array-like, shape=(n_samples,)
        weights[i] is the weight given to point a[i] while computing the
        quantile. If weights[i] is zero, a[i] is simply ignored during the
        percentile computation.

    sorter: array-like, shape=(n_samples,)
        If provided, assume that a[sorter] is sorted.

    Returns
    -------
    percentile: float
        Weighted percentile of a at q.

    Notes
    -----
    Note that weighted_percentile(a, q) is not equivalent to
    np.percentile(a, q). This is because in np.percentile
    sorted(a)[i] is assumed to be at quantile 0.0, while here we assume
    sorted(a)[i] is given a weight of 1.0 / len(a), hence it is at the
    1.0 / len(a)th quantile.
